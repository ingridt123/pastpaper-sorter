– 3 – N17/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M 
Section A 
1. Award up to [2 max].
Fixed vocabulary;
Unambiguous meaning;
Consistent grammar;
Consistent syntax;
Provide a way to define basic data types and operations on those types (ability to write
functions/procedures);
Provide ability of Input and output handling;
Provide some kind of loop that can be stopped / conditional statement / branching
(conditional and  unconditional branching);
It should have variables that reference computer memory, syntax for basic arithmetic
and logical
operations on those memory locations;
It has to run on/be processed by a computer (ie it must have a compiler/interpreter);
Note: do not accept aspects that address interoperability/portability/standards/
user friendliness [2] 
2. (a) A piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made
available by a server /  
The role of a client is to access a service made available by a server by sending 
a request for service; 
Note: the term client is to be understood only from the computing perspective, 
ie this is not a human. [1] 
(b) A program/host computer that awaits and fulfills requests from client programs (in
the same or other computers) /
The role of a server is to fulfill requests from client programs (which can reside in
the same or in other computers)
Note: the term server is to be understood only from the computing perspective,
ie this is not a human. [1]
3. Award up to [1 max].
Text-to-speech;
Voice recognition;
Braille keyboards;
Touch screen;
Input from scanner; [1] 
4. Award [1] for all correct input values, [1] for a correct A NOR B column and [1] for a
correct (A NOR B) OR A column.
A B A NOR B (A NOR B) OR A 
FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE 
FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE 
TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE 
TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE 
[3]
– 4 – N17/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M 
5. Award [1] for each correctly placed gate, up to [3 max].
[3] 
Note: Award only [1] for an answer of: 
6. (a) 5; [1] 
(b) Award up to [3] as follows:
[3] for fully correct response (sequence of output) “0;2;4”;
[2] for response (sequence) “4;2;0” (all elements are correct, but they are in
inverse order);
[1] for response ”0” (only base case is correct);
OR
“0;2” (incomplete output, but initially correct, and with correct order);
OR
“–2;0;2;4”,“0;2;4;6” (correct sequence immersed in some unnecessary and
incorrect context);
[0] in all other cases (eg responses “2”, “4”, “2;0”, “2;4”, “4;2”);
0 
2 
4 [3] 
(c) Example answer 1
Award marks as follows up to [4 max]. (There are 5 marking points);
Award [1] for determining whether N is odd/even;
Award [1] for correctly initializing and changing the value of the loop controlling
variable (K);
Award [1] for the correct condition in the while loop;
Award [1] for output within the loop for an even N;
Award [1] for output after the loop for an odd N;
– 5 – N17/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M 
 mystery(N) 
if N mod 2 = 0 then 
K = 0 
loop while K <= N 
  output K 
K = K + 2 
end loop
 else 
  output N 
 end if 
end mystery 
Example answer 2 
Award marks as follows up to [4 max]. (There are 5 marking points); 
Award [1] for determining whether N is odd/even; 
Award [1] for correctly initializing and changing the value of the loop controlling 
variable (K); 
Award [1] for the correct condition in while loop (note K < N); 
Award [1] for output within the loop for an even N; 
Award [1] for outputting N after the loop; 
mystery(N) 
K = 0 
loop while (K < N) AND (N mod 2 = 0)  
  output K 
K = K + 2 
end loop  
 output N 
end mystery
Note: No marks for any attempt of program that contains recursive calls. 
Reminder: in the Spanish version mystery() is called incognita(). 
Remark: A correct program produces in output numbers in an ascending order, only. [4] 
7. (a) Primary memory / RAM [1] 
(b) Award up to [2 max].
Note: there must be explicit reference to both address and data bus.
Example 1
Buses are used as physical connections to carry information to the CPU;
The data bus transports data from/to CPU, whereas the address bus the memory
address where the data is supposed to go/be;
Example 2
Data bus is a physical connection to transport data from-to CPU to be processed;
Address bus is a physical connection to transport an address of memory storage
where data (transported in the data bus) should be read/written;
Note: Award [1], for responses that show some understanding of use of buses in
CPU, for address location and data transport without using specialist
terminology. [2]
– 6 – N17/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M 
8. Binary digit;
(Minimal) unit of storage that can be set to 0 or 1; [1] 
9. Award up to [2 max].
It involves sending sample software to the intended audience;
(Selected audience does not pay for this software);
To try/use the software product;
And give the feedback to the authors (which help in correcting bugs); [2]
