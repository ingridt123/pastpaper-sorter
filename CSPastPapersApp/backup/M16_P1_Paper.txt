Answer all questions.
11.	 An	examination	office	of	a	university	must	securely	store	students’	examination	papers	and	
their	grades.		The	office	keeps	the	documentation	of	past	students	for	two	years.		After	two	
years	the	office	only	stores	the	student	grades.		All	documentation	of	current	students	is	
frequently accessed for other operations and the volume of the data increases quickly. 
	 To	better	support	its	operations,	the	office	is	creating	a	new	system	to	provide	this	storage.	
 (a) Identify two aspects of the data that need to be taken into account during the planning 
of the new system. [2]
 (b) Describe how direct observations on the current system may provide information to 
help propose a suitable new system. [3]
	 A	prototype	of	the	new	system	is	created	to	present	to	the	examination	office.
 (c) Describe the purpose of this prototype.  [3]
	 The	examination	office	needs	to	upgrade	the	computing	resources	for	their	operations,	and	
this will require data migration.
 (d) Discuss two possible problems that may occur during data migration. [4]
 (e) Outline one	economic	aspect	that	the	examination	office	needs	to	take	into	account	to	
support parallel running. [3]
12. A college has a high-speed network.  The network is accessible to all students and staff 
through their personal accounts.
 The network may be accessed by using desktop computers available in the college.  When 
in the college, users can also use personal laptops to connect wirelessly or dock with an 
Ethernet cable.  When not in the college, users can connect via a virtual private network (VPN) 
over the internet. 
 (a) In the given context, distinguish between Ethernet and wireless in terms of reliability  
of transmission. [4]
 (b) Describe two features of a VPN that make it secure. [4]
 (c) State one technology that is necessary for a VPN. [1]
The college is devising a policy for the use of its IT resources and services.  They are 
considering prohibiting the use of external services such as cloud storage and blogs.
	 (d)	 In	relation	to	the	specific	activities	that	may	be	carried	out	by	students,	discuss	two 
advantages and two disadvantages of the use of external services.   [6]

13. A local charity organizes a half-marathon to raise money.  The rules to participate in the  
half-marathon are as follows:
y The organizers limit the total number of participants to 450
y	 Participants	belong	to	a	team	and	each	team	must	have	at	least	three	and	at	most	five	
participants
y Each participant registers for the event independently from the other members of their 
team, and they all declare their team name when registering
y	 For	scoring,	the	team’s	final	time	is	the	sum	of	the	times	of	its	three	fastest	participants.		
Participants	that	do	not	cross	the	finishing	line	within	2	hours	after	the	start,	are	assigned	
a default time of 1000 minutes.  The winning team is the team with the smallest sum total.
 
 During registration, an array, PARTICIPANTS, with 450 positions is used to hold the 
abbreviated team names that are declared by each participant.  Simultaneously, a collection 
TNAMES is generated: any new team name that is declared is added to the collection.
 (a) State the minimum size of TNAMES to ensure the names of all potential teams can  
  be stored.  [1]
 Part of the array PARTICIPANTS	is	shown	below,	where,	for	example,	the	first	participant	
declared that they are part of team TK.  The initial part of the collection TNAMES is also shown, 
with arrows indicating the direction of growth.
PARTICIPANTS
[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] …
TK W AC TK W TK AC W TK TK AC QA AC W AC …
TNAMES
TK W AC QA …
 Both PARTICIPANTS and TNAMES are used to construct the array, TEAM, that groups all 
participants who belong to the same team.  Part of the array TEAM is shown below. 
TEAM
[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] …
3 4 6 5 7 8 10 13 9 0 12 73 14 15 2 …
 In TEAM, each element is related to one other index in the array, shown by the arrows on the 
above diagram.  This relation will eventually form a closed path (for this example 0, 3, 5, 8, 9 
and	back	to	0).		The	relation	reflects	the	information	in	PARTICIPANTS, by grouping people 
who declared the same team name during registration.
 Hence, participants 0, 3, 5, 8 and 9 are on the same team and, from PARTICIPANTS, that team 
is TK.

(Question 13 continued)
 (b) Identify the position in PARTICIPANTS of the second participant that registered for  
team QA. [1]
 Part of the algorithm that generates the TEAM array is shown below, in pseudocode.
	 //Input	PARTICIPANTS	array,	TNAMES	collection
	 TEAM	 //	array	with	450	positions,	initialized	to	‘999’
	 CURRENT	//	variable	to	store	current	name	of	team;
	 T,	P	 //	variables	to	store	the	indexes	of	TEAM	and	PARTICIPANTS,
	 	 //	respectively;
	 MINP	 //	stores	the	first	index	P	of	members	of	the	CURRENT	team;
	 TNAMES.resetNext() 
loop	while	TNAMES.hasNext()
	 	 	 	 CURRENT	=	TNAME.getNext()
	 	 	 	 T	=	0;	P	=	0;	MINP	=	0	 //	variables’	initialization
    //*
    //* Code to be completed in part (c)(i)
    //*
    //* Code to be completed in part (c)(ii)
    //*
 end loop
	 output	TEAM
 (c) In order to complete this code, and return the correct TEAM array, 
	 	 (i)	 construct	pseudocode	to	find	MINP,	the	first	index	in	PARTICIPANTS of the 
CURRENT team, and use it to start the construction of TEAM [3]
	 	 (ii)	 construct	pseudocode	to	find	the	other	participants	belonging	to	the	CURRENT 
team, implementing the idea of the closed paths in the TEAM array.  [4]
 As part of the program to determine the winning team, an array, TIMING, is maintained in 
parallel to PARTICIPANTS.  For example, TIMING[5] and PARTICIPANTS[5] relate to the 
same participant.  
 TIMING	is	initialized	to	zero	before	the	race	starts,	and	updated	with	the	finishing	times	for	
each participant.  The algorithm sum3best is able to output the sum of the three fastest times 
from any group of times that are passed to the algorithm.
	 (d)	 Describe	the	steps	of	an	algorithm	that	will	find	the	winning team,	as	defined	by	the	
marathon rules on page 6.  Clearly mention the use of existing or of new data structures. [6]
